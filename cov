This series unifies the linux loader for ARM64 & RISC-V. The linux loader
for ARM64 is pretty much arch independent. Thus, this series just moves
it to the common directory and update the make files.

This series also removes the arch specific kernel image haders for
ARM64, RISC-V, ARM as suggested on v6[1].I have verified with coreboot,
efi platform options for ARM. I am not that well versed with ARM options.
If it causes any more build failure, please scream at me again :).

This series has been tested with OpenSuse image in Qemu for RISC-V1.
For ARM64,ARM it has been compile tested only.
It would be good to get more testing on ARM64 and real RISC-V boards as well.

Sorry for the delay in sending the series. Hopefully, it has not delayed the
grub release plan.

Changes from v7->v8:
1. Removed the arch specific header for ARM as well.
2. Fixed ARM64 load image header with random COFF header placement.

Changes from v6->v7:
1. Rebased on top of the latest upstream.
2. Addressed all the comments on v6.
3. Removed arch specific image header files for ARM64 & RISC-V.

Changes from v5->v6:
1. Rebased on top of Ard's latest LoadFile2 series.

Changes from v4->v5:
1. Removed redundant macros from header file and updated the rv32
   kernel header structure.

Changes from v3->V4:
1. Added all the comments on v3.
