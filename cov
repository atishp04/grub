This series unifies the linux loader for ARM64 & RISC-V. The linux loader
for ARM64 is pretty much arch independent. Thus, this series just moves
it to the common directory and update the make files.

This series is rebased on top of Ard's LoadFile2 series[1].

The unification effort was a little mess and I was to blame :(.
I started the effort but couldn't follow up after. Nikita picked it up
and rebased all the patches along with LoadFile2.

However, Nikita did not follow up after v3 as well. Ard revised his
LoadFile2 series few weeks back. As the ocotober deadline for next grub
release is closing, I decided to rebase the patches so that RISC-V support
can be officially part of the release. Sorry for the mess/confusion.

This series has been tested with OpenSuse image in Qemu. It would be good
to get more testing on ARM64 and real RISC-V boards as well.

Changes from v5->v6:
1. Rebased on top of Ard's latest LoadFile2 series.

Changes from v4->v5:
1. Removed redundant macros from header file and updated the rv32
   kernel header structure.

Changes from v3->V4:
1. Added all the comments on v3.
2. Dropped LoadFile2 patches as Ard's series[1] updated those patches
